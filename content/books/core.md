# Core
Rules and procedures for interstallar role-play in the classic style, for one referee and two or more players.

## A Long Fall
Ancient beyond memory and long assumed to be unassailable,The Empire's kiloparsec reach finally exceeded its grasp. Now, in the time of its extended decline, comes a reordering. Worlds struggle between themselves to survive the dying convulsions of a decaying hegemony. Strife brings opportunity and danger.

## Throws & Impact
In moments of danger or uncertainty, players roll 2d6. On a total of 8 or higher, the character succeeds. Otherwise they fail and suffer consequences. If an action is impossible, or requires specialized knowledge or tools the player's character (PC) doesn't have, they fail automatically.

Sometimes successful throws can have additional effects, measured in **impact**.A throw has an impact equal to the total result minus 7. Impact is used chiefly during combat.


## Skills
PCs have **skills**, specific areas of expertise in which they are experienced. Each skill has a numbered rank. Add a skill's rank to throws where the skill applies. There are two types of skills, **core** skills and **specialist** skills.

Every PC has the three core skills: **Strength**, **Agility**, and **Tech**. These represent broad competence, and do not confer any specialized knowledge.A high agility rank doesn't make someone an acrobat, and a high tech score doesn't let you hack cybersecurity or forge digital documents.

Specialist skills are determined by a PC's **past life**, the person they were before the game started.They are more specific areas of expertise. Examples of specialist skills are Forgery, Field Medic, Geology, or Poison. There is no finite list of specialist skills, and when you create new past lives for your game, you will find yourself inventing new ones.

A rank of 1 or higher in a specialist skill represents at
least entry-level professional knowledge in the field. For certain very complex tasks, a PC will automatically fail if they don't have the skill at all. For example a PC without any ranks of surgery or a similar skill simply cannot perform brain surgery without killing the patient.


## Past Lives
Each PC has a past life describing the person they were before the beginning of the game. PC's have a rank in their past life that represents the prestige won,contacts made, and in the case of military characters, literal rank achieved. Characters get their starting specialist skills from their past life.


## Luck
PCs have a resource called **luck**. Players track their current and maximum luck.They'll have 7/9 luck or 10/10 luck, etc.

After making a throw, a player may spend a point of their current luck to re-roll one of the dice, using the new total for the throw.They may keep re-rolling,
spending a luck each time. If a re-rolled die comes up a 1, the throw automatically fails.The action goes wrong in the worst possible way, and the PC permanently reduces their maximum luck to the level of their current luck.

If a PCs maximum luck ever reaches zero, they burn out and retire whenever next makes sense.

A PC's maximum luck increases by 2 every in-game year at the beginning of their birth month, never higher than 10.

## Conditions
Bad things happen to PCs. They might get drunk, or poisoned, or get a broken leg, or a chest wound. These are all **conditions**. Write conditions on a PC's character card with a severity rating, like "Hand Laceration 3". Subtract the severity of a PC's worst condition to any throw where it would be an impediment. If a PC has the condition "Massive Hangover 1", they subtract 1 from throws to do just about anything.


## NPCs
Non-player characters have a single **skill** stat which they use for all throws that fall under their areas of expertise.
