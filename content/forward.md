# Forward
Night Tripper is a starting point. Use these procesdures as written only as long as they serve your shared goals. Hack, expand, and repurpose them without hesitation. They assume a group of three or more, with one person acting as Referee and the others as players controlling individual characters. The players create and pursue their own goals in a world sketched out by the referee. The group fills in the details of the world over time.

The referee adjudicates fictional outcomes and applies rules as necessary. If something comes up and the rest of the table thinks the referee is full of it, the referee is wrong.

Roleplaying is best done with people you know, like, and trust. Talk with your group about safety and off-limits content. Research and use TTRPG safety tools.

Night tripper can also serve as a skeleton for solo play. Make a crew, start with a ship and corresponding debt. Travel, trade, and encounter other vessels. Try to stay intact and in the black.
