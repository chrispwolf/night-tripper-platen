# Interstellar Adventure Role-Play
### By Chris P Wolf

Night Tripper is a lightweight set of rules for playing interstellar science fiction role-playing games. It is heavily inspired by the original 2d6 sci-fi games of the 70's & 80's. It attempts to capture the same spirit of improvisation and open-ended possibility, while greatly reducing bookkeeping and cognitive load on the referee.

Night Tripper is still in development, and this site will be updated with new features and revised rules over time.
