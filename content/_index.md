## Interstellar Adventure Role-Play (beta)
### By Chris P Wolf

Rules & tools for interstellar science fiction role-playing games. Inspired by the original 2d6 interstellar game of the 1970s. Aims to capture the same spirit of improvisation and open-ended possibility.

A sparse and adaptable sci-fi system, intentionally thin on setting details. Make a star map and drop in your favorite adventures for any system. You can convert stats on the fly.

Still in development; this site will be updated with new features and revised rules over time.

Night Tripper is free. Please make a [donation to Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/donate/).
