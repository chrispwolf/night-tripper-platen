# Interstellar Adventure Role-Play (BETA)
### By Chris P Wolf

Night Tripper is a lightweight set of rules for playing interstellar science fiction role-playing games. It is heavily inspired by the original 2d6 sci-fi game of the 1970s. It attempts to capture the same spirit of improvisation and open-ended possibility, while greatly reducing bookkeeping and cognitive load on the referee.

It is a generic and adaptable sci-fi system, intentionally sparse on setting details. Make a star map and drop in your favorite published sci-fi adventures for any system. Converting to Night Tripper can be done on the fly.

Night Tripper is still in development, and this site will be updated with new features and revised rules over time.

Night Tripper is free. If you think it's worth money, double the amount in your head and [donate it to Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/donate/).
