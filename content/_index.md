# Interstellar Adventure Role-Play (BETA)
### By Chris P Wolf

Night Tripper is a lightweight set of rules for interstellar science fiction role-playing games. It is inspired by the original 2d6 sci-fi game of the 1970s, and attempts to capture the same spirit of improvisation and open-ended possibility, while reducing bookkeeping and cognitive load on the referee.

Night Tripper is a sparse and adaptable sci-fi system, intentionally thin on setting details. Make a star map and drop in your favorite adventures for any system. You can convert any numbers on the fly.

Night Tripper is still in development, and this site will be updated with new features and revised rules over time.

Night Tripper is free. If you think it's worth money, double the amount in your head and [donate it to Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/donate/).
