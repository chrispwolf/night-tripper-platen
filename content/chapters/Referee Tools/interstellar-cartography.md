# Interstellar Cartography

## Worlds
Worlds are described by four attributes, each ranked from 1 to 6. 
+ Habitability: The capacity of the world to comfortably sustain human life.
+ Population: The number of people living on the world.
+ Authority: The strength and presence of legal authorit on the world.
+ Technology: How common and accessible advanced technology and manufacturing is on the world.

## Preparing a star map
Before a game the referee may map a small interstellar volume for play.

Roll several dice across a sheet of paper. Five should be plenty, three in a rush. The locations of the dice mark the locations of significant star systems on your map.The number showing on each die is the local world’s Habitability rank.

Place a dot on the spot where each die landed and note it’s habitability.

Roll the remainder of each world’s attributes using the tables on the following pages. Roll 1d6 on each table and note the results. Rolls may affect later rolls. Finally, calculate the world’s Technology attribute.

Draw lines connecting each world to its nearest neighbors. These are travel routes. A route of about the length of your index finger is 2 parsecs. The shortest routes are 1 parsec.

## World Generation
### Habitability
| Rank (1d6) | Population modifier and world type.  |
|-|-|
| 1. | Population -1, Type (d3): 1. A cluster of asteroids, 2. Planet with highly corrosive atmosphere, 3.  Rad-soaked ball of rock |
| 2. | Population -1, Type (d3): 1. An ancient & decaying megastructure, 2. A world under constant meteor barrage, 3. A geologically unstable world |
| 3. | No modifier, Type (d3): 1. A planet with frequent acidic rainfall, 2. A tidally-locked world, 3. An ancient megastructure, partially functioning and partially fallen to strange wilderness |
| 4. | No modifier, Type (d3): 1. A planet with failed or partial terraforming, 2. An endless frozen tundra, 3. An endless bone-dry desert |
| 5. | Population +1, Type (d3): 1. A planet with a narrow area near the equator ideally suited for human life, 2. A world of nearly 100% oceans, 3. A lush world full hostile life |
| 6. | Population +1, Type (d3): 1. A successfully terraformed planet. Its biome highly uniform and gentle, 2. An ancient megastructure, still fully functional and self-sufficient, 3. A naturally ideal planet, Earth-like |

### Population
| Rank (1d6) | Modifiers and approximate population |
|-|-|
| 1. | -1 Authority and Technology. Fewer than one hundred thousand  |
| 2. | -1 Authority and Technology. Hundreds of thousands |
| 3. | No Modifiers. Millions |
| 4. | No Modifiers. Ten to one hundred million |
| 5. | +1 Authority & Technology. Hundreds of millions |
| 6. | +1 Authority & Technology. Billions |

### Authority
| Rank (1d6) | Technology Modifiers and description |
|-|-|
| 1. | -1 Technology. No recognized authority or system of laws.  |
| 2. | -1 Technology. Laws are extremely localized and generally permissive |
| 3. | No Modifier. Authority is decentralized across multiple polities, states or corporations. |
| 4. | No Modifier. Authority is mostly centralized but rather permissive. Carrying military weapons in public is illegal and enforced. |
| 5. | +1 Technology. Authority is centralized and strict. Weapons are banned for civilians except in wilderness areas. |
| 6. | +1 Technology. Authority is ever-present. Surveillance is ubiquitous, and laws are harshly enforced. |

### Technology
A planet's Technology attribute always starts at 3. Add or subtract any modifiers from Population and Authority. Lastly, if Population is higher than Habitability, add 1 to Technology.
