# Preparing to Play
Use the tools in the following chapters to create an interstellar sandbox setting before the game. In just a few steps you can quickly write up several neighboring worlds and their inhabitants, and feel confident about turning your players loose. Follow these steps.


## 1. The Star Map
Use the method in [Interstellar Cartography] to generate and map the worlds of your cluster. You will quickly get a high level of detail from this step alone. Some worlds will be far more hospitable than others. Some will be far more populous or wealthy. They will have different styles of government and different needs. Begin thinking about which worlds are in conflict with one another, and what the people might be like on different worlds. If like me, you use a notebook to organize your thoughts, it can be useful to give each world its own two-page spread to track ideas and details.

## 2. Organizations
Organizations are the large groups and factions in your cluster. The [Organizations] section has example skeletons for a number of organizations. Choose three or four of these that fit well within the worlds of your cluster and flesh them out with names and details, or invent your own from scratch.

## 3. Encounters
Prepare two lists of six encounters. Who are the spacefaring agents of your organizations? Who are the people that they push to the perifery? These are your Insiders and Outsiders.

## 4. Opportunities
Lastly, prepare two or three opportunities. An opportunity is a job, task, or piece of information that the players can choose to act on. Rumors of a rare resource in a dangerous location. Coordinates to a lost imperial facility. A member of an organization looking to hire flunkies for some dirty work.
