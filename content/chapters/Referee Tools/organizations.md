# Organizations
Organizations are the movers and shakers of your cluster. Groups large, powerful, or ambitious enough to change the fates of billions. The movements of Organizations drive conflict and change in the cluster, creating new situations, opportunities and dangers for the PCs.

Before the campaign, make 3â€“5 organizations. Look at your worlds. Their attributes and government types will suggest lines of power, conflict, and trade. Use these to inspire organizations. In your campaign notebook, dedicate a single page to each organization. Each organization has:

* An agenda
* Methods
* Goal
* Base of operations
* NPCs

An organization's Agenda is its ongoing purpose, its reason for existing. Its Methods are ways in which it acts on its agenda and excercises power. Its Goal is the next step it is going to take, a specific action where it will use its Methods in service of its Agenda. Most organizations have a base of operations on a single world. Make a note of which. Finally, describe two important NPCs related to the organization. One at the top of the power structure like a leader or executive, and one lower down who the players will interact with if they do business with the organization.
