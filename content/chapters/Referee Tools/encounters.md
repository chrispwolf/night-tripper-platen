# Encounters

As stated in the [Starships & Travel](/chapters/Rules-for-Play/starships-travel) rules, the referee rolls 1d6 each time the players enter or leave a star system, and once per week when traveling within a system. If the roll is equal to or less than the world's Population attribute, an encounter occurs. The referee must determine who the players encounter, and the disposition of the encountered vessel.

## Encounter Lists

Before play, prepare a list of encounters for each world, numbered from 1 to 6. For the first session, don't hesitate to repeat encounters on a world's list, or use the same encounters on multiple worlds. Remember that your prep should be easy and fun. Encounters numbered lower than the world's Authority attribute should be Insiders, and those higher should be Outsiders. The encounter numbered equal to Authority can be either, or can be an insider and outsider in conflict. When an encounter occurs in play, roll 1d6 and introduce the corresponding encounter, rolling disposition if necessary.

The labels of Outsider and Insider are broad descriptors of a relationship to power structures and local authority. They are fuzzy around the edges, and are not value judgements. An encounter with corrupt militia members can be just as dangerous or more than an encounter with pirates. See the lists below for examples, or add them directly to your game.

### Example Insiders
1. System Militia patrolling in a gunship
2. Noble's pleasure yacht
3. Luxury Liner
4. Gigacorp CEO in a branded cruiser
5. Prisoner Transport
6. Merchant, laden with goods

### Outsiders
1. Ice miners on strike
2. Pirate Raiders
3. Subversive artist
4. War refugees
5. Smugglers
6. Resistance fighters

## Disposition
Unless the disposition of an encountered NPC is a foregone conclusion, the referee should roll on the following table to determine how NPCs feel about the PCs at the beginning of an encounter. Interpret the result within the bounds of the situation. Frequently a "very negative" result indicates an immediate attack.

| 2d6 | Disposition |
|-----|-------------|
| 2 | Very Negative |
| 3–5 | Negative |
| 6–8 | Neutral / Guarded |
| 9–11 | Positive / Helpful |
| 12 | Very Positive / Friendly |
