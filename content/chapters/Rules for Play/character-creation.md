# Character Creation
Use an index card to keep a record of your character. Follow these steps:

## 1. Luck & Physical Characteristics
Your maximum luck starts at 10.

Roll 2d6 each for your Strength and Agility characteristics to find their starting rank on the table below:

| Roll (2d6) | Characteristic rank |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 2-5                    | 0                   |
| 6-8                          | 1                   |
| 10-11                          | 2                   |
| 12                           | 3                   |


## 2. Career
You begin at 18 years old.

Choose a career below, and gain a free listed skill of your choice at rank 1.

Undergo as many Career Terms as you wish. In each term, roll 2d6 and consult the Career Term table, below. Your character can gain skills, feel the effects of age, lose luck, or die as indicated. If you don't die, add 5 years to your character's age. A character dies if their maximum luck falls to 0 or less.

On any result higher than 3, you will make a skill roll. Roll 1d6 and either gain the corresponding skill from your career path at rank 1, or increase its rank by 1 if you have it already. On a 6, your character moves to a new, randomly determined career path. Roll again on the new path. If you roll a 6 again, ignore it and re-roll. Roll skills from the new career path in subsequent terms.

When you gain the weapon skill and a specific weapon category is given in parenthesis, gain that skill at rank 1. If none is given, roll for a random weapon category.

If you gain the weapon skill again you may increase a skill you already have, or roll a random new one.

You may end your career after any term your character survived. Continue character creation.

## 3. Personal Details & Past
Roll a random Birth Month. Examples given are for the imperial calendar. The corresponding personality trait represents general beliefs about people born in that month.

Roll a random Downfall, the reason you moved from your previous life into a wandering life of adventure.

Roll a random Personal Item.

Consider the details of your Career. Who was this person before the game? Discuss it with the referee. Give your Career a title and note it along with its rank. A player whose character's skills come from the Spacer and Merchant groups might decide they were a smuggler. A Soldier character might have been a mercenary, a rebel, or member of a state's armed forces.

Name your character and give them a strong visual detail.
