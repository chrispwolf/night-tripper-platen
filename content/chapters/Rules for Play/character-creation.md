# Character Creation
Use an index card to keep a record of your character. Follow these steps:

## 1. Age & Luck
Roll your character's age: 2d6x5 years. Minimum 20. Your current and maximum Luck is 12 minus the tens digit of your age (e.g. a 35-year-old character has a starting Luck of 9/9).

## 2. Physical Characteristics
Roll 2d6 each for your Strength and Agility characteristics, and subtract the tens digit of your age to each 2d6 roll. Compare each result on the table below and note their physical characteristic ranks.

| Roll 2d6 - tens digit of age | Characteristic rank |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 3 or less                    | 0                   |
| 4–5                          | 1                   |
| 6–8                          | 2                   |
| 9+                           | 3                   |


## 3. Career 
Your Career rank starts at 1. Get a number of Career dice equal to the tens digit of your age. For each die, choose a skill group below and roll. If you don't have the indicated skill yet, gain it at rank 1. If you do, increase its rank by 1. On a roll of 6, choose one skill from the group and increase Career rank by 1. You may roll all the dice in the same skill group, or split them between two groups.

When you gain the Weapon, Vehicle, or Science skill, roll on the corresponding specific skill list and gain the indicated skill.

## 4. Personal Details & Past
Roll a random Birth Month. Examples given are for the imperial calendar. The corresponding personality trait represents general beliefs about people born in that month.

Roll a random Downfall, the reason you moved from your previous life into a wandering life of adventure.

Roll a random Personal Item.

Consider the details of your Career. Who was this person before the game? Discuss it with the referee. Give your Career a title and note it along with its rank. For example, a player whose character's skills come from the Spacer and Merchant groups might decide they were a smuggler. If their Career rank was 2, they'd write "Smuggler 2" on their character card.

Name your character and give them a strong visual detail.
