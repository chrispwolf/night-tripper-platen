# Character Creation
Use an index card to keep a record of your character. Follow these steps:

## 1. Luck & Physical Characteristics
Your maximum luck starts at 10.

Roll 2d6 each for your Strength and Agility characteristics to find their starting rank on the table below:

| Roll (2d6) | Characteristic rank |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 2-5                    | 0                   |
| 6-8                          | 1                   |
| 0-11                          | 2                   |
| 12                           | 3                   |


## 2. Career
You begin at 18 years old. Your Career rank starts at 0.

Choose a skill group below, and gain a free listed skill of your choice at rank 1.

Undergo as many Career Terms as you wish. In each term, roll 2d6 and consult the Career Term table, below. Your character can gain skills, feel the effects of age, lose luck, or die as indicated. If you don't die, add 5 years to your character's age.

When you gain the weapon or vehicle skill and a specific weapon or vehicle category is given, gain that skill at rank 1. If none is given, roll for a random weapon or vehicle category.

If you gain the weapon or vehicle skill again you may increase a skill you already have, or roll a random new one.

Before any term after the first, you may choose to switch to a different skill group. You may only do this once, and do not a free skill.

You may end your career after any term your character survived. Continue character creation.

### Career Term Table

|-|-|
| 2-3 | Death |
| 4-6 | Injury or aging effects. Lose one rank in a physical characteristic, or 1d3 maximum luck. Characteristics may not be lowered to less than 0. Death if maximum luck falls to 0 or less. |
| 7-9 | Roll 1d6 and either gain the corresponding skill from your skill group at rank 1, or increase its rank by 1 if you have it already. Lose 1 Maximum luck.|
| 10+ | Roll for a skill as above, but lose no luck. |

## 3. Personal Details & Past
Roll a random Birth Month. Examples given are for the imperial calendar. The corresponding personality trait represents general beliefs about people born in that month.

Roll a random Downfall, the reason you moved from your previous life into a wandering life of adventure.

Roll a random Personal Item.

Consider the details of your Career. Who was this person before the game? Discuss it with the referee. Give your Career a title and note it along with its rank. For example, a player whose character's skills come from the Spacer and Merchant groups might decide they were a smuggler. If their Career rank was 2, they'd write "Smuggler 2" on their character card.

Name your character and give them a strong visual detail.
