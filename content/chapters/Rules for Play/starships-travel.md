# Starships & Travel
These rules cover small craft like light freighters, gunboats and pleasure yachts. Capitals and other large ships should be treated as set pieces and terrain. You won't win in a fight against them.

The players may start with a starship. If they do, they are likely in debt for the full cost to a bank, loan shark, ship manufacturer, or other entity. Standard loan repayment terms are 1.5% of the total cost of the ship paid out over 100 months. At the end of 100 months, the PCs will have paid 150% of the cost of the ship. Round fractions of a credit up.

## Ship Attributes
* Systems: The speed, capacity, and power of the vessel's primary computer, sensor array, and engineering section.
* Acceleration: Speed and maneuverability granted by the vessel's realspace drive and thrusters.
* Guns: The number and power of weapons. Usually turrets armed with laser cannons.
* Quarters: The number of staterooms on board. Luxury passengers and officers will expect a private room. Crew on military vessels sleep four to a room.
* Hold: The size of the vessel's cargo hold in Loads. 1 Load is the size of a real-world cargo container.

\* ***No gate core. Incapable of interstellar travel.***

## Travel
Ships with a gate core travel 1 parsec per week through interstellar space. Within a star system, a ship can hop between major locations instantly. Ships can only safely enter or leave gate space when a significant distance from large objects. A ship can hold 4 fuel in its fuel tanks. 1 fuel is expended for each parsec of interstellar travel.

## Ship Encounters
When arriving in a new system, traveling between locations within a system, or leaving a system, the referee checks for encounters with other vessels. An encounter occurs on a 1d6 roll equal to or less than the local world's Population attribute. The referee section has tools for randomizing encounters and determining the disposition of encountered ships.
