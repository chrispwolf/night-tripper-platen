# Core

## A Long Fall
Ancient beyond memory and long assumed unassailable, the Empire's kiloparsec reach finally exceeded its grasp. In the time of its extended decline comes a reordering. Worlds struggle between themselves to survive the dying convulsions of a geriatric hegemony. Strife brings opportunity and danger.

## Fundamentals
A collection of rules and procedures for interstellar adventure role-play campaigns. For one referee and any number of players; three to five being a good range.

The referee creates several worlds stocked with opportunities to pursue, dangers to surmount, and organizations pursuing their own ends. During play, the referee describes environments and the actions of non-player characters and creatures. The players describe their characters' actions, and the referee adjudicates outcomes.

To play you will need at least two six-sided dice (d6), index cards, and pencils.

Certain rules call for using a 3-sided die (d3). In these cases, roll 1d6. A roll of 1–2 is 1, 3–4 is 2, 5–6 is 3.

Some tables call for using a "d66," in this case, use 2d6, designate on die for the tens digit and the other for the ones digit. Read a roll of 3 and 4 as 34.

Lastly, some tables call for a d12. If you don't have a 12-sided die on hand use this method. Roll 1d6 and note the result. Roll a second d6. if the second result is 1-3, use the first result as-is. If the second result is 4-6, add 6 to the first result. A roll of 3 then 2 is 3. A roll of 5 and 4 is 11.

## Throws & Impact
When a player character takes a dangerous or uncertain action, their player rolls 2d6. On a total of 8 or higher, the character succeeds. Otherwise, they fail and suffer consequences as determined by the referee. If an action is impossible, or if the PC lacks necessary tools or knowledge, they fail automatically.

If one of a player character's skills or characteristics is relevant to the task, they add its rank to the throw.

Sometimes successful throws can have additional effects, measured in Impact. A throw has an Impact equal to the total result minus 7. Impact is used chiefly for damage in combat, but can also be used to represent complex, time-consuming tasks. For example, if a character attempts to hack into a database during a tense combat situation, the referee might require them to accrue a total of 3 cumulative Impact, rolling once each skirmish round.

## Limits
Certain throws, particularly in skirmishes and ship combat, are Limited. A throws Impact cannot exceed its Limit. A total throw of 12 with a limit of 2 has an Impact of 2.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
Certain circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage on a throw. If a throw is Advantaged, roll 3d6 and use the highest 2 for the result. If Disadvantage, roll 3d6 and use the lowest 2.

## Physical Characteristics & Skills
PCs have two physical Characteristics. Strength is power and endurance. Agility is quickness and coordination.

PCs also have skills in specific areas of expertise. A rank of 1 in a skill is baseline professional knowledge. A rank of 3 is a career's worth of expertise. Ranks of 4 or higher are exceptional. 

For complex technical tasks, a PC will automatically fail if they don't have the skill at all. A PC without any ranks of Medic cannot perform brain surgery without killing the patient.

## Luck
PCs have a resource called Luck. Players track their current and maximum luck. They'll have 7/9 or 5/5 Luck, etc.

After making a throw, a player may spend 1 point of their Luck to re-roll 1 of the dice, using the new total for the throw. They may keep re-rolling,
spending 1 luck each time. If a re-rolled die shows a value of 1, the throw automatically fails. The action goes wrong in the worst possible way, and the PC reduces their maximum Luck to the level of their current Luck.

If a PC's maximum Luck ever reaches zero, they burn out and retire whenever next makes sense.

PCs regain Luck when they can spend time in safety, either at port or on board the ship. If a PC doesn't use any Luck for 2 weeks, they regain 1 Luck, up to their current maximum.

## Conditions
Bad things happen to PCs. They might get drunk, or poisoned, or get a broken leg, or a chest wound. These are Conditions. Write Conditions on a PC's character card, with a Severity rating, like "Nauseous". A condition imposes Disadvantage on any relevant throws. If a PC has the Condition "Broken Leg", any throws to run, jump, climb, etc are Disadvantaged.

## NPCs
Non-player characters can be described by a single Skill stat, ranked 1 or higher, which they use for all throws that fall under their areas of expertise. The referee may flesh out more important NPCs with a specific list of skills.
