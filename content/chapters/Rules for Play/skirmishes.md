# Skirmishes
When a fight is simple, resolve it with a single throw. If the outcome is a foregone conclusion, just say what happens. For more complex skirmishes, use these rules.

## Rounds
When a skirmish breaks out, split the game action into rounds. Each character may perform one action in a round. Actions are performed in the following order:

1. Talking
2. Melee attacks: advantaged, matched, then disadvantaged
3. Movement
4. Miscellaneous
5. Ranged Attacks, in order shown on the ranged attack chart

Characters performing the same action do it simultaneously. Characters do not have to decide their action at the beginning of the round. The referee should call out each action type in order, and announce which NPC's will act. The players may then announce if they are performing the current action. 

## Attacks & Wounds
To attack an enemy in a skirmish, make a throw + relevant weapon skill. Add or subtract a modifier based on the weapon you are using. Modifiers are detailed in the melee and ranged attack sections. Use the hit location chart along with the lower die of an attack throw to determine hit location.

The target of an attack gains a wound condition with a severity equal to the impact of the throw. Combined with the hit location, the target will get a condition like "Leg wound 1" or "Head wound 3." If the total severity of wounds to a character's head or torso is 4 or more, the character is killed. If the total severity of wounds to legs or arms is 4 or more, a limb will need an autoprosthetic or vat-grown replacement. Determine left or right randomly.

PC's can avoid a wound by reducing their current luck by the impact of the attack. They may not reduce a wound by paying a portion of the impact, nor may they reduce their current luck to less than 0.

Armor ignores damage from one attack of the wearer's choosing, then must be replaced.

Laser weapons shoot beams of focused light, and armor is useless against them.

## Skirmish Actions
### Talking
If you choose to talk as your action, you can say a few words before anything else happens. Maybe if you are diplomatic you can stop this foolishness before it starts.

## Melee Attacks
A combatant with a longer weapon begins with the advantage over one with a shorter weapon. At their discretion, the referee can declare the opposite, for situations such as using a halberd in a space station maintenance tunnel.

Advantaged melee attacks get a +2 modifier, matched melee attacks +1, and disadvantaged melee attacks +0.

If a disadvantaged melee attacker successfully hits their target (gets 1 or more impact on the attack throw), they have gotten inside (or outside) their opponents reach and have the advantage in the next round.

## Movement
You can run about 30' over open ground.

## Miscellaneous
Sometimes you have to turn a crank or operate a computer or drive a gravcar or inject healing nanites while people are fighting.

## Ranged Attacks
Ranged attackers use the ranged attack chart (p. 7) to determine their modifier, based on the weapon they are using and the range to their target. Ranged attacks are made in the order listed on the ranged attack chart.

The weapons detailed in the chart represent broad categories of firearms. Add additional rows to the chart as needed in your campaign.
