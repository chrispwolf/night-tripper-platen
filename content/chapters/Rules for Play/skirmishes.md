# Skirmishes
When a fight is simple, resolve it with a single throw. If the outcome is a foregone conclusion, just say what happens. For more complex skirmishes, use these rules.

## Rounds
When a skirmish breaks out, divide game time into rounds. Each character may perform one action in a round. Resolve actions in the following order:

1. Talking
2. Melee attacks
3. Movement
4. Miscellaneous
5. Ranged attacks and aiming, in order shown on the ranged attack chart

Characters performing the same action do it simultaneously. Characters do not have to decide their action at the beginning of the round. Call out each action type in order, and announce which NPC's will act. The players may then announce if they are performing the current action. 

## Attacks & Wounds
To attack an enemy in a skirmish, make a throw + relevant weapon skill. Use the hit location chart along with the lower die of an attack throw to determine hit location.

Wounds are a type of Condition that include a Severity rating. The target of an attack gains a Wound condition with a Severity equal to the impact of the throw. Leg Wound 3, for example.

If the total combined severity of a character's wounds is 4 or more they go out of action and cannot act until the skirmish is over. If a single body location takes wounds totaling 5 or more severity, apply the following effects depending on location:
* Head: instant death.
* Torso: mortal wound. Death in 1d6 hours without stabilizing medical attention.
* Legs or arms: A limb is destroyed. Randomly determine left or right.

PCs may avoid a Wound by reducing their current Luck by the full impact of the attack. They may not reduce their current Luck to less than 0.

Combat armor ignores damage from one attack of the wearer's choosing, then must be replaced.

Laser weapons shoot beams of focused light, and render conventional armor useless.

The Logistics & Ports chapter contains [rules for medical care](/chapters/Rules-for-Play/logistics/#medical-care).

## Skirmish Actions
### Talking
Say a few words before anything else happens. Maybe if you are diplomatic you can stop this foolishness before it starts.

### Melee Attacks
Resolve all melee attacks simultaneously.

Melee weapons are short (knife), medium (club, sword), or long (spear).

A combatant wielding a long weapon makes Advantaged attacks against one using a medium or short weapon. Medium weapons are Advantaged against short weapons. Attacks with short weapons are Disadvantaged against long weapons.

At their discretion, the referee can declare the opposite, flipping advantages. For example, if character A, armed with a sword, fights character B, armed with a halberd, in a space station maintenence tunnel, A's attack would be Advantaged, and B's attack would be thrown normally.

### Movement
You can run about 30' over open ground.

### Miscellaneous
Turn a crank, operate a computer, drive a gravcar or inject healing nanites.

### Ranged Attacks & Aiming
Make ranged attacks in order from top to bottom on the Ranged Attack Chart. Depending on the range of the attack, a weapon might be Advantaged (+), Disadvantaged (-), normal (N) or unable to attack (X).

In lieu of making a ranged attack, a character may spend the round aiming. A character who aims may upgrade a disadvantaged attack to a normal one, or grant advantage to a normal attack.

The weapons in the chart represent broad categories of firearms. Add additional rows to the chart as needed in your campaign.
