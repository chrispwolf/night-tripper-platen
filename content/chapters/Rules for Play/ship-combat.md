# Ship Combat
Combat between ships combines the skills of a crew with the quaity of their ship. The maximum impact of any throw is limited to the rank of a ship's component. NPC ships use the skill rank of their crew for all throws.

*A player fires the guns on a ship with Guns 1. They throw a total of 10. The impact of the throw is 1, not 3.*

First, assign each ship a position score equal to the higher of its electronics or thrusters rank. Use counters or dice to track the position of each ship. A ship with higher position than another is better situated and can more easily achieve its goal.

*A ship with electronics 1 and thrusters 2 starts an engagement with position 2.*

Each crew then declares their goal for the encounter. See the table below for common goals and requirements for achieving them. A crew achieves its goal if it meets the necessary requirements at the end of a round. The referee sets requirements for goals not listed.

At any point, either side can surrender and grant the enemy their goal. Either side may change their goal at the beginning of a new round.

| Goal | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| Escape by jumping to gatespace | Position 2 greater than enemy's & fully operational gate core. |
| Escape to nearby world | Position 3 greater than enemy's & fully operational thrusters. |
| Forcibly dock with and board enemy ship | Position 4 greater than enemy's & enemy thrusters destroyed. |
| Board by leaping from your ship to theirs. | Position 4 greater than enemy's. Boarders throw + Agility to land on enemy hull. |

The players choose which characters will operate their ship's computer, helm the ship, shoot the guns, and perform repairs. A single character may only perform one of these tasks each round. If there are not enough characters to perform each task, the players must choose which task to skip.

Take the following steps each combat round:
1. Computer
2. Side 1 Helm
3. Side 1 Gunnery
4. Side 2 Helm
5. Side 2 Gunnery
6. Engineering

## Computer
Computer operaters uses their ship's electronics to try to predict the enemy's movement. Each side throws + computer skill, impact limited by the ship's electronics rank.

The side with the highest impact performs its helm and gunnery tasks first. If neither side throws 8 or more, or if it is a tie, the side with the highest position goes first.

If it is still a tie, resolve the helm and gunnery tasks simultaneously. Throw gunnery for the NPCs first, but the players ignore damage when shooting back.

## Helm
The ship's pilot throws + helm skill, impact limited by the ship's thrusters. Add the impact of the throw to the ship's position.

## Gunnery
The ship's gunner throws + gunnery skill, impact limited by the ship's guns. The enemy ship suffers one hit for each point of impact.

For each hit, the crew of the target ship chooses to either take the hit or dodge it. If they take the hit, they lose 1 position and the attacker rolls on the hit location table below. If they dodge the hit, they lose 3 Position. Position cannot be reduced to less than 0. A ship with 0 Position takes every hit.

The attacker may spend position to increase or decrease a hit location die by 1 for each point of position spent.

The first time thrusters, guns, electronics, or Gate Core are hit, that component is damaged. The second time, it is destroyed.

Throws using damaged thrusters, guns, or electronics are disadvntaged. Make the throw on 3d6 and discard the highest die. A damaged gate core cannot be used to jump to gatespace. Destroyed systems cannot be used until repaired in port.

When PC crew is hit, throw an attack with a +2 bonus against a random PC, using the [skirmish rules](https://www.night-tripper.fun/chapters/rules-for-play/skirmishes/#attacks--wounds). If NPC crew is hit, reduce NPC ship skill by 1. This can cause their skill to become negative.

### Hit Location (1d6)
| Roll | Hit Location & Effect |
|------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Electronics |
| 2 | Thrusters |
| 3 | Guns |
| 4 | Gate core |
| 5 | Crew |
| 6 | Attacker chooses hit. Any of the above, or another contextual choice. For example breaching thier cargo hold so a specific item falls into space. |

## Engineering
Each ship's engineer throws + Engineer. If succesful, they may either jury rig a damaged component, or boost an intact component to grant one teammate advantage on their throw during the next round. Jury rigged components operate as normal during the next round. Destroyed components cannot be jury rigged, and need to be replaced in port.
