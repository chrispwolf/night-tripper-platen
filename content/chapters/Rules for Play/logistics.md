## Time & Money
The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.

One credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.

Travel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC's can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals. Extensive starship repairs are measured in weeks. 

One month is four weeks, and a year is 12 months.
