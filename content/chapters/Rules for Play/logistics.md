# Logistics

## Time & Money
The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.

One credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.

Travel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC's can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals. Extensive starship repairs are measured in weeks. 

One month is four weeks, and one year is 12 months. The referee should keep a calendar of the current week, mongh, and year of the campaign world.

## Equipment
The following are lists of equipment and their costs. Listed costs assume the item is readily available on a world. For worlds with a very low Tech attribute, costs may be much higher for technological items. Other events in the campaign like blockades or trade disputes may also affect the costs of equipment, at the referee's discretion.

### One Credit Buys
* A medical kit
* A mechanical tool kit (wrenches, spanners, wire cutters, etc)
* A portable computer
* A portable lab
* A cutting laser
* Etc.

## Ports
Worlds with a Technology attribute of 3 or more have a dedicated star port. In port, PCs can purchase equipment, repair their ship, and look for new opportunities.

### Weekly Procedure
Take the following steps each week the PC's spend in port:

1. The PCs pay 1 credit docking and resupply fee for the ship. This entitles them to the space for up to one week.
2. The PCs pay 1 credit each for basic lifestyle upkeep and lodgings.
3. Roll fow law enforcement encounter. Roll 2d6, if the total is equal to or lower than the world's Authority attribute, local authorities approach the PCs and will ask for identification, cargo manifest, etc.
4. Buy and sell any trade goods.
5. Commission any starship repairs
6. Each PC may perform one of the following tasks for the duration of the week:
    * Seek out an opportunity for the crew
    * Attempt to hire specialist NPCs
    * Recieve medical care

### Weekly Expenses
* 1 credit docking and resupply fee
* 1 credit/person lifestyle expenses

### Starship Repair Costs
* Per point of damage, for each component: 1 credit
* Per destroyed component: +10 Credits
* Damaged gate core: 20 credits
* Destroyed gate core: 50 credits

### Starship Repair Time
* All damaged components: 1 week
* Per destroyed component: +1 week

### Seeking opportunities
PCs may throw to hear about an opportunity available on the world. Opportunities can anything from rumors about derelict ships to wealthy patrons willing to pay for a dangerous task. If a PCs Career Rank applies to any opportunities the referee has prepared, they may add it to the throw.

Opportunities need not be local to the current world. If the Referee has no adventure prepared locally, the PCs may get information about an opportunity that requires travel.

Tools for generating opportunities between game sessions or on the fly are forthcoming.

### Hiring NPCs
PCs attempting to hire on NPCs make a throw each week, adding their Career rank if it applies to the type of NPC being sought out. On a succesful throw, a specialist is found. A specialist's maximum skill rank is 3, or the Impact of the hiring throw, whichever is lower.

NPCs will at a minimum expect 1 credit per week per rank of Skill. For highly specialized or dangerous tasks, they may demand as much as double that.

Multiple PCs may throw to find the same specialist.

### Medical Care
Removing all Wound conditions requires a number of weeks of medical care equal to the Severity of a character's worst Wound. Reduce total healing time by one week for each rank of the world's Tech attribute above 3, with a minimum of 1 week. 

On worlds without free medical care, healing will cost 1 credit per Severity of each healed Wound.

On worlds with an Authority of 3 or higher, injuries sustained by violence will usually prompt questions from law enforcement.
