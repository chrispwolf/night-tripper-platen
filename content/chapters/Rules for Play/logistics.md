# Logistics

## Time & Money
The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.

One credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.

Travel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC's can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals. Extensive starship repairs are measured in weeks. 

One month is four weeks, and one year is 12 months.

## Equipment
The following are lists of equipment and their costs. Listed costs assume the item is readily available on a world. For worlds with a very low Tech attribute, costs may be much higher for technological items. Other events in the campaign like blockades or trade disputes may also affect the costs of equipment, at the referee's discretion.

### One Credit Buys

* A mechanical tool kit (wrenches, spanners, wire cutters, etc)

## Ports &  Ship Expenses
Worlds with a Technology attribute of 3 or more have a dedicated star port. In port, PCs can purchase equipment, repair their ship, and look for new opportunities.

Ports charge a standard docking fee of 1 credit per week. Additionally, personal lifestyle expenses for PCs cost 1 credit per week per person.

Starship repairs cost 5 credits per point of damage, plus 10 credits if the component was destroyed. A damaged gate core costs 20 credits to repair. A destroyed gate core costs 50 credits to replace. It takes 1 week to repair all damaged components. Each replaced destroyed component adds one additional week to repair times. For example, a ship repairing its damaged systems and guns, and replacing its gate core takes 2 weeks to repair.

Starship fuel costs 1 credit for 2 units of fuel.

## Hiring NPCs
NPCs can be hired to fill gaps in the PCs' skills, or to perform specific tasks. NPCs will at a minimum expect 1 credit per week per rank of Skill. For highly specialized or dangerous tasks, they may demand as much as double that.

## Healing
Removing all Wound conditions requires a number of weeks of appropriate medical care euqual to the Severity of a character's worst Wound. Depending on the nature of the Wounds, these weeks may be inpatient, outpatient or a combination.

On worlds without free medical care, healing will cost 1 credit per Severity of each healed Wound.

On worlds with an Authority of 3 or higher, injuries sustained by violence will usually prompt questions.
