# Logistics

## Time & Money
The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.

One credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.

Travel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC's can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals. Extensive starship repairs are measured in weeks. 

One month is four weeks, and one year is 12 months.

For worlds with a very low Tech attribute, costs may be much higher for technological items.
