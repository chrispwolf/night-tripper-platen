      <description>Interstellar Cartography #  Before a game the referee may map a small interstellar volume for play, comprising several worlds. Worlds are described by four attributes, each ranked from 1 to 6: Habitability, Population, Authority, and Technology.
Roll several dice across a sheet of paper. Five should be plenty, three in a rush. The locations of the dice mark the locations of significant star systems on your map.The number showing on each die is the local worldâ€™s Habitability rank.</description>

      <description>World Details #  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve made a basic map of several worlds and their attributes, flesh out each world with the following details. World details will inform each other, and details added to one world may lead you to change details on another. Let the process be iterative, and your worlds will feel more deeply connected to one another.
Before the first session, keep these details as brief as possible.</description>

      <description>Encounters #  As stated in the Starships &amp;amp; Travel rules, the referee rolls 1d6 each time the players enter or leave a star system, and once per week when traveling within a system. If the roll is equal to or less than the world&amp;rsquo;s Population attribute, an encounter occurs. The referee must determine who the players encounter, and the disposition of the encountered vessel.
Encounter Lists #  Before play, prepare a list of encounters for each world, numbered from 1 to 6.</description>
