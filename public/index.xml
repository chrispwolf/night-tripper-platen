      <description>Foreword #  Night Tripper is a starting point. A set of light and modular tools, rules and procedures. Use them as written only as long as they serve your shared goals. Hack, expand, and repurpose them without hesitation. They assume a group of three or more, with one person acting as Referee and the others as players controlling individual characters.
Night Tripper is not original. If you are familiar with the earliest 2d6 interstellar role-playing games, you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize a lineage.</description>

      <description>Core #  A Long Fall #  Ancient beyond memory and long assumed unassailable, the Empire&amp;rsquo;s kiloparsec reach finally exceeded its grasp. In the time of its extended decline comes a reordering. Worlds struggle between themselves to survive the dying convulsions of a geriatric hegemony. Strife brings opportunity and danger.
Fundamentals #  A collection of rules and procedures for interstellar adventure role-play campaigns. For one referee and any number of players; three to five being a good range.</description>

      <description>Interstellar Cartography #  Before a game the referee may map a small interstellar volume for play, comprising several worlds. Worlds are described by four attributes, each ranked from 1 to 6: Habitability, Population, Authority, and Technology.
Roll several dice across a sheet of paper. Five should be plenty, three in a rush. The locations of the dice mark the locations of significant star systems on your map.The number showing on each die is the local worldâ€™s Habitability rank.</description>

      <description>World Details #  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve made a basic map of several worlds and their attributes, flesh out each world with the following details. World details will inform each other, and details added to one world may lead you to change details on another. Let the process be iterative, and your worlds will feel more deeply connected to one another.
Before the first session, keep these details as brief as possible.</description>

      <guid>https://night-tripper.netlify.app/chapters/Referee-Tools/encounters/</guid>
      <description>Encounters #  As stated in the Starships &amp;amp; Travel rules, the referee rolls 1d6 each time the players enter or leave a star system, and once per week when traveling within a system. If the roll is equal to or less than the world&amp;rsquo;s Population attribute, an encounter occurs. The referee must determine who the players encounter, and the disposition of the encountered vessel.
Encounter Lists #  Before play, prepare a list of encounters for each world, numbered from 1 to 6.</description>

      <description>Skirmishes #  When a fight is simple, resolve it with a single throw. If the outcome is a foregone conclusion, just say what happens. For more complex skirmishes, use these rules.
Rounds #  When a skirmish breaks out, divide game time into rounds. Each character may perform one action in a round. Resolve actions in the following order:
 Talking Melee attacks Movement Miscellaneous Ranged attacks, in order shown on the ranged attack chart  Characters performing the same action do it simultaneously.</description>

      <guid>https://night-tripper.netlify.app/chapters/Rules-for-Play/logistics/</guid>
      <description>Logistics &amp;amp; Ports #  Time &amp;amp; Money #  The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.
One credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.
Travel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC&amp;rsquo;s can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals.</description>

      <description>Starships &amp;amp; Travel #  These rules cover small craft like light freighters, gunboats and pleasure yachts. Capitals and other large ships should be treated as set pieces and terrain. You won&amp;rsquo;t win in a fight against them.
Other than shuttles and other short-range craft, most ships are outfitted with a gate core. A gate core enables a ship to jump to gatespace and travel many times the speed of light.</description>

      <description>Trade #  Most interstellar trade and shipping is carried out by immense freighters, contracted by the Guilds. However, small independent vessels can turn a regular profit by speculating on expensive goods, buying low and selling high.
There are four broad categories of trade goods, each corresponding to one world attribute. Use the table below to determine the local price of a trade good category. Goods in demand on a world cost 4d6 credits per load.</description>

      <description>Ship Combat #  Combat between ships combines the skills of a crew with the quaity of their ship. Any character may make any of the throws in a ship combat round, gaining a bonus as normal if they have the corresponding skill. However, the maximum impact of any throw is limited to the rank of the ship&amp;rsquo;s component.
A player fires the guns on a ship with Guns 1. They throw a total of 10.</description>

The players create and pursue their own goals in a world sketched out by the referee. The group fills in the details of the world over time.</description>
