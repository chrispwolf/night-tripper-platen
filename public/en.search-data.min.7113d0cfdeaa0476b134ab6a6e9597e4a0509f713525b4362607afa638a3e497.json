Use them as written only as long as they serve your shared goals. Hack, expand, and repurpose them without hesitation. They assume a group of three or more, with one person acting as Referee and the others as players controlling individual characters.\nNight Tripper is not original. If you are familiar with the earliest 2d6 interstellar role-playing games, you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize a lineage. Night Tripper aspires to that spirit of improvisation, open-endedness and malleability.\nThe players create and pursue their own goals in a world sketched out by the referee. The group fills in the details of the world over time. Ideally the referee follows the players' lead and responds to them, not the other way around.\nThe referee adjudicates fictional outcomes and applies rules as necessary. If a disagreement comes up and the rest of the table thinks the referee is full of it, the referee is wrong.\nRoleplaying is best done with people you know, like, and trust. Talk with your group about safety and off-limits content. Research and use TTRPG safety tools.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/chapters/Rules-for-Play/core/","title":"Core","section":"Rules for Play","content":"Core #  A Long Fall #  Ancient beyond memory and long assumed unassailable, the Empire\u0026rsquo;s kiloparsec reach finally exceeded its grasp. In the time of its extended decline comes a reordering. Worlds struggle between themselves to survive the dying convulsions of a geriatric hegemony. Strife brings opportunity and danger.\nFundamentals #  A collection of rules and procedures for interstellar adventure role-play campaigns. For one referee and any number of players; three to five being a good range.\nThe referee creates several worlds stocked with opportunities to pursue and dangers to surmount. During play, the referee describes environments and the actions of non-player characters and creatures. The players describe their characters' actions, and the referee adjudicates outcomes. Rules assist this process by injecting unpredictablility or impartiality when desirable.\nTo play you will need at least two six-sided dice (d6), index cards, and pencils.\nCertain rules call for using a 3-sided die (d3). In these cases, roll 1d6. A roll of 1–2 is 1, 3–4 is 2, 5–6 is 3.\nSome tables call for using a \u0026ldquo;d66,\u0026rdquo; in this case, use 2d6, with one designated as the tens digit and the other as the ones digit. For example, read a roll of 3 and 4 as 34.\nThrows \u0026amp; Impact #  When a player character takes a dangerous or uncertain action, their player rolls 2d6. On a total of 8 or higher, the character succeeds. Otherwise, they fail and suffer consequences as determined by the referee. If an action is impossible, or if the PC lacks necessary tools or knowledge, they fail automatically.\nIf one of a player character\u0026rsquo;s skills or characteristics is relevant to the task, they add its rank to the throw.\nSometimes successful throws can have additional effects, measured in Impact. A throw has an Impact equal to the total result minus 7. Impact is used chiefly for damage in combat, but can also be used to represent complex, time-consuming tasks. For example, if a character attempts to hack into a database during a tense combat situation, the referee might require them to accrue a total of 3 cumulative Impact, rolling once each skirmish round.\nPhysical Characteristics \u0026amp; Skills #  PCs have two physical Characteristics. Strength is power and endurance. Agility is quickness and coordination.\nPCs also have skills in specific areas of expertise. A rank of 1 in a skill is baseline professional knowledge. A rank of 3 is a career\u0026rsquo;s worth of expertise. Ranks of 4 or higher are exceptional.\nFor complex technical tasks, a PC will automatically fail if they don\u0026rsquo;t have the skill at all. For example a PC without any ranks of Medic simply cannot perform brain surgery without killing the patient.\nCareers #  During character creation each player will describe a Career for their character based on their skill groups and specific skills. For example, a player whose character has skills in the Spacer and Soldier groups might decide that the character was an orbital marine.\nPCs have a rank in their Career, representing prestige earned and contacts made. During play, a PC may add their Career rank to throws for networking tasks, like locating and requesting help from contacts.\nLuck #  PCs have a resource called Luck. Players track their current and maximum luck. They\u0026rsquo;ll have 7/9 or 10/10 Luck, for example.\nAfter making a throw, a player may spend 1 point of their Luck to re-roll 1 of the dice, using the new total for the throw. They may keep re-rolling, spending 1 luck each time. If a re-rolled die shows a value of 1, the throw automatically fails. The action goes wrong in the worst possible way, and the PC reduces their maximum Luck to the level of their current Luck.\nIf a PC\u0026rsquo;s maximum Luck ever reaches zero, they burn out and retire whenever next makes sense.\nPCs regain Luck when they can spend time in safety, either at port or on board the ship. If a PC doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any Luck for 2 weeks, they regain 1 Luck, up to their current maximum.\nConditions #  Bad things happen to PCs. They might get drunk, or poisoned, or get a broken leg, or a chest wound. These are Conditions. Write Conditions on a PC\u0026rsquo;s character card with a Severity rating, like \u0026ldquo;Nauseous 3\u0026rdquo;. Subtract the severity of a PC\u0026rsquo;s worst Condition to any throw where it is an impediment. For example, if a PC has the Condition \u0026ldquo;Leg Wound 2\u0026rdquo;, they subtract 2 from any throws to run, jump, climb, etc.\nNPCs #  Non-player characters can be described by a single Skill stat, ranked 1 or higher, which they use for all throws that fall under their areas of expertise. The referee may flesh out more important NPCs with a specific list of skills.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/chapters/Referee-Tools/interstellar-cartography/","title":"Interstellar Cartography","section":"Referee Tools","content":"Interstellar Cartography #  Before a game the referee may map a small interstellar volume for play, comprising several worlds.

The players may then announce if they are performing the current action.\nAttacks \u0026amp; Wounds #  To attack an enemy in a skirmish, make a throw + relevant weapon skill. Use the hit location chart along with the lower die of an attack throw to determine hit location.\nAttacks can be Advantaged or Disadvantaged. If Advantaged, an attacker throws 3d6 and uses the two highest dice for the throw. If Disadvantaged, they throw 3d6 and use the two lowest.\nThe target of an attack gains a Wound condition with a severity equal to the impact of the throw. Combined with the hit location, the target will get a condition like \u0026ldquo;Leg wound 1\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Head wound 3.\u0026rdquo;\nIf the total combined severity of a character\u0026rsquo;s wounds is 4 or more they go out of action and cannot act until the skirmish is over. If a single body location takes wounds totaling 4 or more severity, apply the following effects depending on location:\n Head: instant death. Torso: mortal wound. Death in 1d6 hours without stabilizing medical attention. Legs or arms: A limb is destroyed. Randomly determine left or right.  PCs may avoid a Wound by reducing their current Luck by the full impact of the attack. They may not reduce their current Luck to less than 0.\nArmor ignores damage from one attack of the wearer\u0026rsquo;s choosing, then must be replaced.\nLaser weapons shoot beams of focused light, and render conventional armor useless.\nThe Logistics \u0026amp; Ports chapter contains rules for medical care.\nSkirmish Actions #  Talking #  Say a few words before anything else happens. Maybe if you are diplomatic you can stop this foolishness before it starts.\nMelee Attacks #  Resolve all melee attacks simultaneously.\nMelee weapons are short (knife), medium (club, sword), or long (spear).\nA combatant wielding a long weapon makes Advantaged attacks against one using a medium or short weapon. Medium weapons are Advantaged against short weapons. Attacks with short weapons are Disadvantaged against long weapons.\nAt their discretion, the referee can declare the opposite, flipping advantages. For example, if character A, armed with a sword, fights character B, armed with a halberd, in a space station maintenence tunnel, A\u0026rsquo;s attack would be Advantaged, and B\u0026rsquo;s attack would be thrown normally.\nMovement #  You can run about 30' over open ground.\nMiscellaneous #  Turn a crank, operate a computer, drive a gravcar or inject healing nanites.\nRanged Attacks #  Make ranged attacks in order from top to bottom on the Ranged Attack Chart. Depending on the range of the attack, a weapon might be Advantaged (+), Disadvantaged (-), normal (N) or unable to attack (X).\nThe weapons detailed in the chart represent broad categories of firearms. Add additional rows to the chart as needed in your campaign.\nSkirmish Tables #  Ranged Attack Chart #     Weapon Short Range (10m) Medium Range (30m) Long Range (200m) Distant Range (1km)     Pistol N - X X   Scattergun + - X X   Carbine N N - X   Long Rifle - N N N    Wound Location #     Lower Attack Die Location     1 Leg   2 Arm   3–4 Torso   5–6 Head    "},{"id":10,"href":"/chapters/Rules-for-Play/logistics/","title":"Logistics \u0026 Ports","section":"Rules for Play","content":"Logistics \u0026amp; Ports #  Time \u0026amp; Money #  The basic unit of currency in Night Tripper is one credit. The basic unit of time is one week.\nOne credit represents a significant expense. It costs one credit to live in a starport for a week, including food and lodging. You could also spend one credit on a particularly extravagant dinner.\nTravel between star systems is measured in weeks. During a week in port the PC\u0026rsquo;s can pursue opportunities, trade commodities and encounter the locals. Extensive starship repairs are measured in weeks.\nOne month is four weeks, and one year is 12 months. The referee should keep a calendar of the current week, month, and year of the campaign world.\nEquipment #  The following are lists of equipment and their costs. Listed costs assume the item is readily available on a world. For worlds with a very low Tech attribute, costs may be much higher for technological items. Other events in the campaign like blockades or trade disputes may also affect the costs of equipment, at the referee\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nOne Credit Buys #   A medical kit A mechanical tool kit (wrenches, spanners, wire cutters, etc) A portable computer A portable lab A cutting laser Etc.  Weapon \u0026amp; Armor Costs #   Pistols, Scatterguns: 1 credit Carbines, Long Rifles: 10 credits Laser Pistols: 100 credits Laser Carbines, Laser Long Rifles: 200 credits Body armor: 10 credits Concealed body armor (woven into a coat, etc): 10 credits  Transport #   Hover belt: 15 credits Ground car: 30 credits Hover skiff: 100 credits Armored transport: 200 credits Orbital shuttle: 500 credits  Ports #  Worlds with a Technology attribute of 3 or more have a dedicated star port. In port, PCs can purchase equipment, repair their ship, and look for new opportunities.\nWeekly Procedure #  Take the following steps each week the PC\u0026rsquo;s spend in port:\n The PCs pay 1 credit docking and resupply fee for the ship. This entitles them to the space for up to one week. The PCs pay 1 credit each for basic lifestyle upkeep and lodgings. Roll for law enforcement encounter. Roll 2d6, if the total is equal to or lower than the world\u0026rsquo;s Authority attribute, local authorities approach the PCs and will ask for identification, cargo manifest, etc. Buy and sell any trade goods using the trade rules. Commission any starship repairs Each PC may perform one of the following tasks for the duration of the week:  Seek out an opportunity for the crew Attempt to hire specialist NPCs Recieve medical care   Update the campaign calendar by 1 week.  Weekly Expenses #   1 credit docking and resupply fee 1 credit/person lifestyle expenses  Starship Repair Costs #   Per point of damage, for each component: 1 credit Per destroyed component: +10 Credits Damaged gate core: 20 credits Destroyed gate core: 50 credits  Starship Repair Time #   All damaged components: 1 week Per destroyed component: +1 week  Seeking opportunities #  PCs may throw to hear about an opportunity available on the world. Opportunities can anything from rumors about derelict ships to wealthy patrons willing to pay for a dangerous task. If a PCs Career rank applies to any opportunities the referee has prepared, they may add it to the throw.\nOpportunities need not be local to the current world. If the Referee has no adventure prepared locally, the PCs may get information about an opportunity that requires travel.\nTools for generating opportunities between game sessions or on the fly are forthcoming.\nHiring NPCs #  PCs attempting to hire on NPCs make a throw each week, adding their Career rank if it applies to the type of NPC being sought out. On a succesful throw, a specialist is found. A specialist\u0026rsquo;s maximum Skill rank is 3, or the Impact of the hiring throw, whichever is lower.\nNPCs will at a minimum expect 1 credit per week per rank of Skill. For highly specialized or dangerous tasks, they may demand as much as double that.\nMultiple PCs may throw to find the same specialist.\nMedical Care #  Removing all Wound conditions requires a number of weeks of medical care equal to the Severity of a character\u0026rsquo;s worst Wound. Reduce total healing time by one week for each rank of the world\u0026rsquo;s Tech attribute above 3, with a minimum of 1 week.\nOn worlds without free medical care, healing will cost 1 credit per Severity of each healed Wound.\nOn worlds with an Authority of 3 or higher, injuries sustained by violence will usually prompt questions from law enforcement.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/chapters/Rules-for-Play/starships-travel/","title":"Starships \u0026 Travel","section":"Rules for Play","content":"Starships \u0026amp; Travel #  These rules cover small craft like light freighters, gunboats and pleasure yachts. Capitals and other large ships should be treated as set pieces and terrain. You won\u0026rsquo;t win in a fight against them.\nOther than shuttles and other short-range craft, most ships are outfitted with a gate core. A gate core enables a ship to jump to gatespace and travel many times the speed of light. A ship can only enter or leave gatespace a significant distance from worlds or other large bodies.\nThe players may start with a starship. If they do, they are likely in debt for the full cost to a bank, loan shark, ship manufacturer, or other entity. Standard loan repayment terms are 1.5% of the total cost of the ship paid out over 100 months. At the end of 100 months, the PCs will have paid 150% of the cost of the ship. Round fractions of a credit up.\nShip Components #   Electronics: The speed, capacity, and power of the vessel\u0026rsquo;s primary computer and sensor array. Thrusters: Speed and maneuverability granted by the vessel\u0026rsquo;s realspace drive and thrusters. Guns: The number and power of weapons. Usually turrets armed with laser cannons. Quarters: The number of staterooms on board. Luxury passengers and officers will expect a private room. Crew on military vessels sleep four to a room.

Ships with a gate core may hop between locations nearly instantly. The referee rolls for an encounter after making the jump.\nInterstellar Travel #  Ships in gatespace travel between star systems at a speed of one parsec per week. The referee rolls for an encounter in each system traveled through, including the origin and destination. Update the campaign calendar to reflect time spent traveling.\nShip Encounters #  An encounter occurs on a 1d6 roll equal to or less than the local world\u0026rsquo;s Population attribute.

However, small independent vessels can turn a regular profit by speculating on expensive goods, buying low and selling high.\nThere are four broad categories of trade goods, each corresponding to one world attribute. Use the table below to determine the local price of a trade good category. Goods in demand on a world cost 4d6 credits per load. Goods on a supplying world cost 2d6. Average-priced goods cost 3d6.\nA character with the buisiness skill may add or subtract their skill rank to the price of goods. Only one character may apply their skill to a good, and each character may only affect one good per week.\nCrime sometimes pays. Double all costs when buying and selling contraband.\nPrices fluctuate, but not quickly. If the crew waits for one week, they may re-roll a single die of the good\u0026rsquo;s price. They may continue to do this, re-rolling one die per week as long as they like. They will continue to pay docking fees, and may incur attention from authorities if they are sitting in a hangar with a hold full of contraband.\nSpecific trade goods are detailed by the referee.

Any character may make any of the throws in a ship combat round, gaining a bonus as normal if they have the corresponding skill. However, the maximum impact of any throw is limited to the rank of the ship\u0026rsquo;s component.\nA player fires the guns on a ship with Guns 1. They throw a total of 10. The impact of the throw is 1, not 3.\nWhen ships engage each other, first assign each ship Position equal to the higher of its Systems or Thrust rank. Use counters or dice to track the Position of each ship in the conflict. Position represents the current tactical situation of a ship. A ship with higher Position than another is better situated and can more easily achieve its goal.\nEach crew then declares their goal for the encounter. See the table below for common goals and requirements for achieving them. A crew achieves its goal if it meets the necessary requirements at the end of a round. The referee sets requirements for goals not listed and for specific scenarios. At any point, either side can surrender and grant the enemy their goal. Either side may change their goal at the beginning of a new round.\n   Goal Requirements     Escape by gate jumping to gatespace Position 2 greater than enemy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026amp; fully operational gate core.

The players choose which characters will operate their ship\u0026rsquo;s computer, helm the ship, shoot the guns, and perform repaits. A single character may only perform one of these tasks each round. If there are not enough characters to perform each task, the players must choose which task to skip.\nThese are the steps for each combat round, each detailed below:\n Computer Side 1 Helm Side 1 Gunnery Side 2 Helm Side 2 Gunnery Engineering  Computer #  Computer operaters uses their ship\u0026rsquo;s electronics to try to predict the enemy\u0026rsquo;s movement. Each side throws + Computer skill, impact limited by the ship\u0026rsquo;s electronics rank. The side with the highest impact performs its helm and gunnery tasks first. If neither side throws 8 or more, or if it is a tie, the side with the highest position goes first. If it is still a tie, resolve the helm and gunnery tasks simultaneously. Throw gunnery for the NPCs first, but the players ignore damage when shooting back.\nHelm #  The ship\u0026rsquo;s pilot throws + helm skill, impact limited by the ship\u0026rsquo;s thrusters. Add the impact of the throw to the ship\u0026rsquo;s position.\nGunnery #  The ship\u0026rsquo;s gunner throws + gunnery skill, impact limited by the ship\u0026rsquo;s guns. The enemy ship suffers one hit for each point of impact. For each hit, the crew of the target ship choose to either take the hit or dodge it. If they take the hit, they lose 1 position and the attacker rolls on the hit location table below. If they dodge the hit, they lose 3 Position. Position cannot be reduced to less than 0. A ship with 0 Position takes every hit.\nThe attacker may spend position to increase or decrease a hit location die by 1 for each point of position spent.\nThe first time thrusters, guns, electronics, or Gate Core are hit, that component is damaged, the second time, it is destroyed.\nThrows using damaged thrusters, guns, or electronics are disadvntaged. Make the throw on 3d6 and discard the highest die. A damaged gate core cannot be used to jump to gatespace. Destroyed systems cannot be used until repaired in port.\nWhen PC crew is hit, throw an attack with a +2 bonus against a random PC, as if in a skirmish. If NPC crew is hit, reduce NPC ship skill by 1. This can cause their skill to go negative.\nHit Location (1d6) #     Roll Hit Location \u0026amp; Effect     1 Electronics   2 Thrusters   3 Guns   4 Gate core   5 Crew   6 Attacker chooses hit.
